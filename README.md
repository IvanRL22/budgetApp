# BudgetApp
Budget app to learn and practice common libraries and utilities.

As it is a practice app, expect to see wierd configurations, documentation, etc.

## Task tracking
I use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/EQYUTlEr/budgetapp) for organization. This is just for task tracking purposes (and to practice keeping a clear and organized roadmap). 

## Libraries
Uses [SpringBoot 2](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) as of 16/04/2023
