This directory contains all the scripts that were executed to create the current DB
Scripts should be prefaced with three digits, indicating the order of execution. This is for two reasons:
- So that  it is possible to follow the creation process of the DB.
- So that in the future it is possible to implement liquibase to automate DB creation.
